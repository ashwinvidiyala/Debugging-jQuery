# Debugging-jQuery

Our assignment was to clone this repository and correct the jQuery errors.
After fixing the errors, the page now does the following:

Markup: * When the survey button is clicked, the page should alert the user with
          the message that is contained within the appropriate code.
        * When either one of the images is clicked, it should slide up and hide.
          When either one of the small headers underneath each picture is
          clicked, it should slide down and unhide the images.
        * When any of the text within the red div is hovered on, it should
          turn white. This includes the list items and headers.
        * When the link in the red div is clicked, an alert box should
          pop up containing a message.
